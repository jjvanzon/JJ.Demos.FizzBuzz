Introduction

This is a Visual Studio 2010 C# project.

Some posts on the internet suggested, that I have to be able to do this programming task in under 5 minutes if I want to call myself a real programmer. I am not sure how long it took. Not long. So maybe I am an actual programmer.

The task is:

* Output the numbers 1 to 100 on screen.
* Except if it is divisble by 3 then output "Fizz" instead.
* And if it is divisible by 5 then output "Buzz" instead.
* But if it is divisible by both 3 and 5, output "FizzBuzz" instead.
